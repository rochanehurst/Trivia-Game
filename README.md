# Brain Bites â€“ Python Trivia App

This is a simple True/False Trivia game built with Python using the `tkinter` library for the GUI.

It reads a list of questions from `data.py`, displays them one at a time, and gives feedback after each answer. The score updates in real time, and the game ends when all questions have been answered.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Tkinter (built-in GUI library)
